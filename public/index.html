            <h2>RSS for your Github</h2>
        </div>
    	<p>
    		Github Feed generates RSS feeds for your Github commits so that others
    		can subscribe to them through an RSS aggregator like Google Reader. 
    		This might be useful for new updates to a Github Pages blog, new 
    		versioned releases of your software, or anything else you'd like to 
    		share with the world.
    	</p>
    	<h2>How it Works</h2>
    	<p>
    		Go to your repository's admin console and add <a href=".">this address</a>
    		as a post-receive hook. When you want a commit to be added to the RSS
    		feed, add the word <span>@rss</span> anywhere in the commit message. 
    		The commit will then be added into our database. You can then subscribe
    		to the RSS feed at <span>http://ghpages.heroku.com/<em>username</em>/<em>repo</em></span>. 
    	</p>
